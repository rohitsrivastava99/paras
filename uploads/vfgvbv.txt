Main nahi maanta ki hamara desh duniya ka sabse mahaan desh hai. Par ye zaroor maanta hu ki hum mein kabiliyat hai, taakat hai, hamare desh ko mahaan banane ki. Shayad mujhe ye baat kehni nahi chahiye par aapne baat chedi hai isiliye keh raha hu, jab bhi hum mukable mein dabne lagte hain, to hum ek hi cheez ka aadhaar lete hain... sanskaar aur parampara. America ne apne balboote pe tarakki ki hai. Unke apne sanskaar hain, apni parampara. Ab ye kehna ki unke sanskaar, unke rehen-sehen, unki manyataayen galat hain aur hamare sahi, ye galat hai.
Aur zaroori baat ye hai ki yaha log jaati ke aadhaar par bhed-bhaav karte hain.
Maine ye ehsaas kiya hai ki hum aapas mein ladte rehte hain jubki hame ladna chahiye ashiksha ke khilaaf, badti abaadi, bhrashtachaar ke khilaaf. Har din, har roz, galiyo mein sadko mein harkoi yahi kehta rehta hai ki, "Is desh ka kuch nahi ho sakta. Ye desh barbaadi ki taraf bad chuka hai." Agar hum sab yehi kehte rahe to sach-much ek din ye desh barbaad ho jayega.

I don't agree that ours is the greatest country in the world! But I do believe that we have the strength and potential to become great. I shouldn't say this but since you have broached the topic let me say that, whenever we suspect losing in comparision, then we clutch on to our favourite refuge... culture and tradition America has progressed on its own strenghths. They have their own culture, traditions. It would be wrong to claim that their culture, their traditions and beliefs are inferior and ours laudable. It's wrong.
What is important is that we make differences based on caste. 
I've realized that we keep fighting among ourselves when we must fight against illiteracy, over-population and corruption. Everyday, in our streets and homes, each one keeps saying, "The country is on the path of destruction." If we keep saying this we will one day land up there.
